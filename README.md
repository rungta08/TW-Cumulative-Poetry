# Cumulative Poetry

We are building a product that will be used in poetry classes. We target a poetry of a form called as cumulative poetry. The functionality is broken down into releases.

## Release 1

**Business needs**

Cumulative poetry shows itself little by little. It’s much like unfolding a tale. The one taught in the class goes like - 

+ Day 1 
```
This is the house that Jack built.
```

+ Day 2
```
This is the malt that lay in
    the house that Jack built.
```

+ Day 3 
```
This is the rat that ate
    the malt that lay in
    the house that Jack built.
```

And so on, as you see the tale is unfolded little by little every day. The whole tale is unfolded on,

+ Day 12
```
This is the horse and the hound and the horn that belonged to
    the farmer sowing his corn that kept
    the rooster that crowed in the morn that woke
    the priest all shaven and shorn that married
    the man all tattered and torn that kissed
    the maiden all forlorn that milked 
    that cow with the crumpled horn that tossed
    the dog that worried 
    the cat that killed
    the rat that ate
    the malth that lay in 
    the house that Jack built.
```
